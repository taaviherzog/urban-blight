# Visualizing Geographical Clustering of Adversity and Affluence in Pittsburgh
This is a project I've been working on in collaboration with professors in the Pitt Business Analytics program, as well as with external stakeholders including Department of Inspections experts.

The project involved three main stages:
 - **Data Retrieval:** This is done via API calls to the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
 - **Data Engineering:** This requires relating multiple datasets via parcel IDs and gocoded coordinates. This is the most extensive step, and makes use of the GeoPandas and Polgyon libraries
 - **Visualization:** This is the final output, providing a visual contrast between Adversity and Affluence for various pockets around the city

This project required that I learn about representing data geospatially.
