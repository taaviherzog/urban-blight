# Identifying properties at risk of deterioration in Pittsburgh
This is a project I've been working on in collaboration with professors in the Pitt Business Analytics program, as well as with external stakeholders including Department of Inspections experts.

The project is intended to be split into three main stages:
 - **Data Retrieval:** This is done via API calls to the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
 - **Data Engineering (incomplete):** This requires relating multiple datasets via parcel IDs and gocoded coordinates
 - **Model Development (not started):** This is intended to be done using Python libraries, primarily scikit-learn

The outcome of this project will be a model that can help assist Pittsburgh's Property Inspectors in identifying vulnerable properties, allowing to address future issues before they reach a problem stage.
